Trickards

Trickards is an exciting memory game that will test your concentration and your ability to spot deception. In this game, each card represents the flag of a country from your class, but not everything is what it seems. The goal is to match the cards correctly—but beware of the decoys!

How to Play

Cards: There are a total of 18 cards. Fourteen of them form pairs of different country flags (each flag card matches with an identical one). The remaining 4 cards are decoys—distracting cards that pretend to be normal cards.

Objective: The objective is to find and match the flags correctly using the fewest attempts possible.

The Decoy Trick

Decoys are deceptive cards. Every time you flip one over, you will see a country. However, if you turn it face down and flip it again in another turn, the country may have changed! This can make you doubt your memory and lose attempts if you fail to quickly identify the card as a decoy.

Identify the decoys quickly: The challenge is not only about remembering the location of the flags, but also about detecting the decoys before they make you lose valuable attempts.

Attempt Limit

There is a maximum number of attempts per game. Each time a card is flipped incorrectly or a decoy is selected, one attempt is deducted. The game challenges you to find the correct pairs and avoid the decoys before your attempts run out.

Game Name: Trickards

The name Trickards is a wordplay between “trick” and “cards”, reflecting the essence of the game: a mental challenge where you must outsmart your senses and overcome the tricks to win.
